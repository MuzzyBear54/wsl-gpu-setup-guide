WSL2 is extremely convenient, but it is not identical to a native Linux HPC node.
This guide favors stability and reproducibility over exotic setups (multi-GPU WSL, bleeding-edge CUDA, etc.).

# Overview

This guide sets up a **reproducible WSL2 GPU build environment** for CUDA-accelerated scientific software.

## Why WSL2 is special (and annoying)
WSL2 behaves differently than native Linux in a few places that matter for HPC/scientific codes:
- GPU access relies on **Windows driver passthrough** (do not install Linux drivers in WSL).
- Some runtimes are sensitive to **memory locking limits** (memlock).
- Certain “local rank / device selection” logic can fail under virtualization.

This repo documents a stable baseline that works well for a single-GPU workstation.

## Design goals
- Reproducible install (same steps → same result)
- Copy/paste config snippets
- Clear troubleshooting (errors → causes → fixes)
- Minimal “magic”

## Repo map
- `docs/` – step-by-step instructions
- `configs/` – env templates and build configs
- `patches/` – WSL2-specific patch examples
- `scripts/` – verification helpers

## Recommended workflow
Follow the docs in order:
1. Windows prereqs
2. Ubuntu setup
3. NVHPC install + environment
4. HDF5 build
5. Build example code
6. Runtime gotchas
7. Troubleshooting
